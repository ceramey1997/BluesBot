This is our README <br><br>

Things to do <br>
- Update readme<br>
- general cleanup<br>
- implement spotify commands on bot side<br>
- invesigate terminal issues<br>
- initialize stop sign in Bluesbot instead of main + make event messages a class variable<br>
- show song length on !queue <br>
- HAVE FUN<br>
- add error handling when youtube download fails<br>
- Continous playing from library<br>
- fix playlist issues<br>
- make song search less sensitive (check for similiarity in words)<br>
- allow bot to join voice channels on more than one server<br>
- potentially dockerize the bot so hosting is easy<br>

to run this bot you need to install: <br>
  - opus <br>
  - youtube_dl <br>
  - ffmpeg <br>
  <br>
 and you need to run no more than python 3.6 but in the 3s <br>
